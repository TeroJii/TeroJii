### Hi I'm Tero ðŸ‘‹ 

Great to see you here! I'm a physicist, research professional, and data scientist. I do most of my current work with R, with a dash of Python, Docker, and other technologies on the side.

*A few random facts:*
- ðŸ‘€ I like pretty visualizations, and elegant data science solutions
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning something new, for example:
    -  how to write more elegant R packages
    -  deep learning stuff with Python
- ðŸ’¡ I find containerized code and applications with Docker fascinating.

Find more about me from my [website](https://terojii.github.io/).
